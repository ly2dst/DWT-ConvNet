	This project is built for classification on the defect of commercial persimmons depending on hyperspectral imaging.
	Due to the size limitation of github, the images of persimmon at wavelenth of 545nm has been extracted as regular image stored in the folder of "dataset", while train and test set have also been divided into different folders.
	The single data has reached the limitation of 25MB,which can't be uploaded to github. For the detailed hyperspectral cube data, you can conduct the author at ly2dst@163.com
 	All the functions such as loading dataset, 2-demension wavelet transaction and multiscale convolution have been generated into the python files. By running train.py model can be built in convenience and efficiency.
